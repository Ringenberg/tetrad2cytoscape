# tetrad2cytoscape
Tools for converting TETRAD graphs to pretty images or
[Cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/) ready json.

This tool was developed to support visualizing graphs from
[cmu-phil/TETRAD](https://github.com/cmu-phil/TETRAD)
in online educational material.

This small tool was developed in support of the educational outreach
of the [Center for Causal Discovery](https://www.ccd.pitt.edu/).

A running copy of the online version of this tool can be found at
https://ringenberg.github.io/tetrad2cytoscape/

An example graph from TETRAD can be found [here](./examples/random_10_node_graph.xml).
